## Annex: Essential Components to consider for a Land Rights System 

As mentioned in the paper before blockchain technology can be optimized in land registration the Afghan government will have to reform the land law.  This list is intended to highlight some of the potential information that would benefit from employing the blockchainâ€™s structure.  Some of the underlying questions that the Afghan Government must answer in order to construct an effective system of land registration employing the blockchain:

1. Fully document who has a claim on the economic activity of the land:
    a. Individual
    b. Tribal affiliation
    c. National tax obligation
    d. Legitimate fees from the government (registration, processing, etc.)
2. What economic activity is permitted: agricultural, industrial, etc. 
3. What method of documentation is planned for this economic activity
4. What secondary uses (re-sale, collateral for credit, futures contracts, crop insurance, etc.) are permitted or need to be documented
5. Mechanism for documentation: private vs public blockchain, roles and permissions, integration and interaction with other blockchains, etc.
