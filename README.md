# Glass Shield


This is the analysis I wrote on the potential to utilize the distributed ledger features of the blockchain for land registration in Afghanistan.  The analysis was for my Masters Thesis from the Flecther School's Global Master of Arts Program [(GMAP)](http://fletcher.tufts.edu/GMAP) and focused on the sociological aspects of integration, not the hurdles of technical implementation.  The information was current as of January 2017.
